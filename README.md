  Welcome to Transcriptomics Lab- Where we do all things RNA:mechanical_arm: :tada: </h2> 
  :man_scientist: :woman_scientist: We are research enthusiasts from diverse backgrounds in life sciences:scientist: :man_scientist:  .In our lab we study transcriptome to provide insight into how genes work:microbe: . This ReadMe provides complete analysis of an RNA-seq experiment profiling Drosophila cells after the depletion of a regulatory gene called Pasilla (Ps).

Enjoy!ðŸŒŸ

*A SNEAK PEEK INTO OUR LAB*

:round_pushpin: Ozone layer depletion is a major concern everywhere, we have seen the adverse effect it has on our environment:slightly_frowning_face:..but,have you ever heard the term "Depletion of Genes"??:eyes:

:grey_question: :grey_question: What happens when a gene is depleted?? Which genes are up or downregulated by the depletion?? Which GO terms or KEGG pathways are involved??:thinking_face:

  - [x] This week our lab will be recreating a galaxy tutorial workflow titled- Reference-Based RNA-seq Data Analysis.:memo:
  - [x] This work is important to us because RNA-seq forms the basics of transcriptomics studies, a large number of valuable knowledge have been gained from RNA-seq and single-cell genomic studies and these knowledge increase our understanding of life science.
  - [X] This tutorial demonstrates computational workflow for the detection of differentially expressed (DE) genes and pathways from RNA-seq data by providing complete analysis of an RNA-seq experiment profiling Drosophila cells after the depletion of a regulatory gene called Pasilla (Ps)
  - [X] Pasilla (the Drosophila homologue of the mammalian splicing regulators NOVA1 and NOVA2 proteins) is a gene that actively regulates "alternative splicing". Alternative splicing is a process by which multiple messenger RNAs (mRNAs) can be generated by joining exons together in different combinations. This process is used to both increase protein diversity and to regulate gene expression.
  - [X] In this project, we will use 4 datasets to demonstrate how to calculate 'read counts' from FASTQ files utilizing the following steps- quality control, mapping and read counting
  - [x] Finally, read counts of all 4 samples will be used to identify and visualize the DE genes, gene families and molecular pathways due to the depletion of the pasilla gene.
